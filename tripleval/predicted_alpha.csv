"Azimuth thruster: Types of azimuth thrusters
Mechanical transmission, which connects a motor inside the ship to the outboard unit by gearing.  The motor may be diesel or diesel-electric.  Depending on the shaft arrangement, mechanical azimuth thrusters are divided into L-drive and Z-drive.  An L-drive thruster has a vertical input shaft and a horizontal output shaft with one right-angle gear.  A Z-drive thruster has a horizontal input shaft, a vertical shaft in the rotating column and a horizontal output shaft, with two right-angle gears.
Electrical transmission, more commonly called pods, where an electric motor is fitted in the pod itself, connected directly to the propeller without gears. The electricity is produced by an onboard engine, usually diesel or gas turbine. Invented in 1955 by Friedrich W. Pleuger and Friedrich Busmann (Pleuger Unterwasserpumpen GmbH), ABB Group's Azipod was the first product using this technology.
