For rapid prototyping this data must represent a valid geometric model; namely, one whose boundary surfaces enclose a finite volume, contain no holes exposing the interior, and do not fold back on themselves. In other words, the object must have an 'inside'. The model is valid if for each point in 3D space the computer can determine uniquely whether that point lies inside, on, or outside the boundary surface of the model. CAD post-processors will approximate the application vendors' internal CAD geometric forms (e.g., B-splines) with a simplified mathematical form, which in turn is expressed in a specified data format which is a common feature in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/3D_printing\">additive manufacturing</a>: <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/STL_(file_format)\">STL</a> file format, a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/De_facto_standard\">de facto standard</a> for transferring solid geometric models to SFF machines.", "To obtain the necessary motion control trajectories to drive the actual SFF, rapid prototyping, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/3D_printing\">3D printing</a> or <i>additive manufacturing mechanism</i>, the prepared geometric model is typically sliced into layers, and the slices are scanned into lines (producing a '2D drawing' used to generate trajectory as in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNC\">CNC</a>'s toolpath), mimicking in reverse the layer-to-layer physical building process.
