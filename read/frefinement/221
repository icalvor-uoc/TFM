He led the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Underground_Church\">London Underground Church</a> from 1587 to 1593, spending most of that time in prison, and wrote numerous works of Brownist apologetics, most notably <i>A Brief Discoverie of the False Church</i>."], "subsections": [{"title": "Life", "sectionItems": ["Barrow was born about 1550, in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norfolk\">Norfolk</a>, of a family related by marriage to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Bacon_(Lord_Keeper)\">Nicholas Bacon</a>, and probably to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Aylmer_(bishop)\">John Aylmer</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bishop_of_London\">Bishop of London</a>. He matriculated at <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clare_College,_Cambridge\">Clare College, Cambridge</a> (then called Clare Hall), in November 1566, and graduated B.A. in 1569\u20131570. Afterwards he 'followed the court' for some time, leading a frivolous if not licentious life. According to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cotton_(minister)\">John Cotton</a>, Barrow gambled a lot and would boast of spending his winnings \u2018in the bosoms of his courtesans\u2019. He was a member of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gray's_Inn\">Gray's Inn</a> for a few years from 1576, but was never called to the bar.", "Early in 1586, Barrow was converted to puritanism by a sermon in a church he had been walking past. Eighteen months later he attempted to write a rebuttal of one of Robert Browne's separatist works, but instead was converted by it. Subsequently, he came into close relations with <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Greenwood_(divine)\">John Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_Dissenters\">Separatist</a> leader. He became associated with the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Underground_Church\">London Underground Church</a>, the illegal Brownist congregation which had been meetings secretly since the late 1560s.", "Greenwood was imprisoned in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Clink\">The Clink</a>, and when Barrow visited him on 19 November 1587 he was detained by the gaoler and brought before Archbishop <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Whitgift\">John Whitgift</a>. He insisted on the illegality of this arrest, refused either to take the <i>ex officio</i> oath or to give <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bail_bond\">bail</a> for future appearance, and was committed to the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gatehouse_Prison\">Gatehouse Prison</a>. After nearly six months' detention and several irregular examinations before the high commissioners, he and Greenwood were formally <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indictment\">indicted</a> at the Newgate Sessions in May 1588 under the 1581 Recusancy Act (originally directed against <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholics\">Roman Catholics</a>). They were fined \u00a3260, then moved to the Fleet prison.", "Barrow was subjected to several more examinations, once before the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Privy_Council_of_England\">Privy Council</a> at <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Whitehall\">Whitehall</a> on 18 March 1589, as a result of petition to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_I_of_England\">the Queen</a>. On these occasions he maintained the principle of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_separatism\">separatism</a>, denouncing the prescribed ritual of the Church as 'a false worship,' and the bishops as oppressors and persecutors.", "During his imprisonments Barrow was engaged in written controversy with <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Browne_(Brownist)\">Robert Browne</a> (down to 1588), who had yielded a partial submission to the established order, and whom he therefore counted as a renegade. He also wrote several treatises in defence of separatism and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregationalist_polity\">congregational independency</a>, including:", ["<i>A True Description of the Visible Congregation of the Saints</i>, &amp;c. (1589)", "<i>A Plain Refutation of Mr Gifford\u2019s Booke, intituled A Short Treatise Gainst the Donatistes of England</i> (1590\u20131591)", "<i>A Brief Discovery of the False Church</i> (1590)."], "Others were written in conjunction with his fellow-prisoner, Greenwood. These writings were entrusted to friends and sent to the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands\">Netherlands</a> for publication.", "By 1590 the bishops had sent several <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conforming_Puritan\">conforming Puritan</a> ministers to confer with these controversialists, but without effect. In 1592 Greenwood, Barrow and John Penry gained a temporary reprieve and began meeting at a house in the Borough and formally constituted the Southwark Independent Church.", "Barrow and Greenwood were returned to the Clink in 1593. It was resolved to proceed on a capital charge of 'devising and circulating seditious books.' As the law then stood, it was easy to secure a conviction. They were tried and sentenced to death on 23 March 1593. The day after sentence they were brought out as if for execution and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Respite_(law)\">respited</a>. On 31 March they were taken to the gallows, and after the ropes had been placed about their necks were again respited. Finally they were <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanging\">hanged</a> early on the morning of 6 April. There is some evidence that the Lord Treasurer <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cecil,_1st_Baron_Burghley\">Burghley</a> endeavoured to save their lives, and was frustrated by Whitgift and other bishops."], "subsections": []}]}}
