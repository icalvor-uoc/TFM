The wording of the oath is specified in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution\">Article II, Section One, Clause 8</a>, of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Constitution\">United States Constitution</a>, and a new president must take it before exercising or carrying out any <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Powers_of_the_president_of_the_United_States\">official powers or duties</a>.", "This clause is one of three <i>oath or affirmation</i> clauses in the Constitution, but it is the only one that actually specifies the words that must be spoken. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution\">Article I, Section 3</a> requires Senators, when sitting to try <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impeachment_in_the_United_States\">impeachments</a>, to be 'on Oath or Affirmation.' <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution\">Article VI, Clause 3</a>, similarly requires the persons specified therein to 'be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution.'

This clause enjoins the new president to swear or affirm that he or she 'will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'"], "subsections": [{"title": "Oath mishaps", "sectionItems": [["In 1909, when President <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Howard_Taft\">William Howard Taft</a> was sworn in, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States\">Chief Justice</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melville_Fuller\">Melville Fuller</a> misquoted the oath, but the error was not publicized at the time. The mistake was similar to the one Taft himself would make twenty years later when swearing in President Hoover. Recalling the incident, Taft wrote, 'When I was sworn in as president by Chief Justice Fuller, he made a similar slip,' and added, 'but in those days when there was no radio, it was observed only in the Senate chamber where I took the oath.'", "In 1929, Chief Justice Taft, himself formerly a president of the United States, garbled the oath when he swore in President <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbert_Hoover\">Herbert Hoover</a> using the words 'preserve, <i>maintain</i>, and defend the Constitution,' instead of 'preserve, <i>protect</i>, and defend.' The error was picked up by schoolgirl Helen Terwilliger on the radio. Taft eventually acknowledged his error, but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the oath. In Taft's view, his departure from the text did not invalidate the oath.", "In 1945, President <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_S._Truman\">Harry S. Truman</a>'s bare initial caused an unusual slip when he first became president and took the oath. At a meeting in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cabinet_Room_(White_House)\">Cabinet Room</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States\">Chief Justice</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harlan_F._Stone\">Harlan Stone</a>, apparently mistaken about the meaning of Truman's middle initial (which is not an abbreviation but rather the whole middle name in itself), began reading the oath by saying 'I, Harry Shipp Truman, ...' Truman responded: 'I, Harry S Truman, ...'", "In both his 1953 and 1957 inaugurations, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> read the line 'the office of President of the United States' as 'the office of <i>the</i> President of the United States,' even as chief justices <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_M._Vinson\">Fred Vinson</a> (in 1953) and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Warren\">Earl Warren</a> (in 1957) said the line correctly.", "In 1965, Chief Justice <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Warren\">Earl Warren</a> prompted Lyndon Johnson to say, 'the Office of <i>the Presidency</i> of the United States.'", "In 1973, President <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Nixon\">Richard Nixon</a> added the word 'and' between 'preserve' and 'protect,' resulting in 'preserve <i>and</i> protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.'  Nixon had recited the line correctly during his first inauguration.", "In 2009, Chief Justice <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Roberts\">John Roberts</a>, while administering the oath to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barack_Obama\">Barack Obama</a>, incorrectly recited part of the oath. Roberts prompted, 'That I will execute the Office of President <i>to</i> the United States <i>faithfully</i>.' Obama stopped at 'execute,' and waited for Roberts to correct himself. Roberts, after a false start, then followed Obama's 'execute' with 'faithfully,' which results in 'execute faithfully,' which is also incorrect. Obama then repeated Roberts' initial, incorrect prompt, with the word 'faithfully' after 'United States.' The oath was re-administered the next day by Roberts at the White House."]], "subsections": []}]}}
