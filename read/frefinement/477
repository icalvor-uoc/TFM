Regardless, all model numbers have an identical appearance. After the rail merger, the KCR logos on the MLR trains were replaced with those of MTR, and a revised route map was introduced in the train interiors. Skirts were also added to all carriages, but the pantograph cars had their skirts removed due to heating issues. The interior floor was also changed for a darker blue in between two red aesthetics, and a brighter blue in between two windows.", "Since the 2007 merger, the MLR was the second oldest variation of EMU operating on the MTR network, behind the M-Trains from 1979. It was also the only electric multiple unit of the Mass Transit Railway that did not have regenerative braking, as noted due to the lack of motor sound and the presence of air brake sounds while braking.
