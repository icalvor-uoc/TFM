Influenced by the earlier success of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewish_philosophy\">Jewish philosophy</a> in articulating a rational study of Jewish thought, Moshe Cordovero produced the first full integration of the previous differing schools in Kabbalistic interpretation. While he was a mystic inspired by the opaque imagery of the Zohar, <i>Cordoverian Kabbalah</i> utilised the conceptual framework of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emanationism\">evolving</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohr\">cause and effect</a> from the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ein_Sof\">Infinite</a> to the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four_Worlds\">Finite</a> in systemising Kabbalah, the method of philosophical style discourse he held most effective in describing a process that reflects sequential logic and coherence. His encyclopedic works became a central stage in the development of Kabbalah.", "Immediately after him in Safed, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Luria\">Isaac Luria</a> articulated a subsequent system of Kabbalistic theology, with new supra-rational doctrines recasting previous Kabbalistic thought. While Lurianism displaced the Cordoverian scheme and became predominant in Judaism, its followers read Cordoverian works in harmony with their teachings. Where to them, Lurianism described the '<a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four_Worlds\">World</a>' of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tikun_(Kabbalah)\">Rectification</a>, Cordovero described the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tohu_(Kabbalah)\">pre-Rectification</a> World. Both articulations of the 16th century mystical Renaissance in Safed gave Kabbalah an intellectual prominence to rival Medieval <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewish_philosophy\">Rationalism</a>, whose social influence on Judaism had waned after the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain\">Expulsion from Spain</a>."], "subsections": [{"title": "Among the Ramak's most visible books", "sectionItems": [["<i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardes_Rimonim\">Pardes Rimonim</a></i> ('An Orchard of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pomegranate\">Pomegranates</a>') - Ramak's first book, an encyclopedic synthesis of the main trends of kabbalistic thought with numerous diagrams, which secured his reputation as a mystical genius.", "<i>Ohr Yakar</i> ('A Precious Light') - a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masterpiece\">Magnum opus</a> of some 16 volumes in its extant manuscript form, which had occupied Ramak throughout his adult life - a classic commentary on the Zohar, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sefer_Yetzirah\">Sefer Yetzirah</a> and the Zoharic literary offshoots.
