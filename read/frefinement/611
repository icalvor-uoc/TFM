The creek's name comes from the Taylor sawmill, which in the late 1880s was located where the creek flowed into Lake Washington, to the east of the park. The ravine has been the focus of efforts to plant native vegetation and restore salmon runs in Taylor Creek. With volunteer effort and some city matching grants, restoration has been underway since 1971. Volunteers have planted thousands of indigenous trees and plants, removed tons of garbage, removed invasive plants, and had city help removing fish-blocking <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culvert\">culverts</a> and improving trails.  Sightings of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raccoon\">raccoons</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opossum\">opossum</a> and birds are common.  Taylor is the fourth-largest creek in urban Seattle.
