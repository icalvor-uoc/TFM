Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.
