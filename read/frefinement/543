It was formulated by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Mandel\">Ernest Mandel</a> and can be viewed as one variant of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx\">Karl Marx</a>'s <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historical_materialism\">historical materialism</a> or as a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy_of_history\">philosophy of history</a>.", "\n\nIn an article critical of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Analytical_Marxism\">analytical Marxism</a> of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Elster\">Jon Elster</a>, Mandel explains the idea as follows: ", "Dialectical determinism as opposed to mechanical, or formal-logical determinism, is also parametric determinism; it permits the adherent of historical materialism to understand the real place of human action in the way the historical process unfolds and the way the outcome of social crises is decided. Men and women indeed make their own history. The outcome of their actions is not mechanically predetermined. Most, if not all, historical crises have several possible outcomes, not innumerable fortuitous or arbitrary ones; that is why we use the expression 'parametric determinism' indicating several possibilities within a given set of parameters."], "subsections": [{"title": "Formal rationality and dialectical reason", "sectionItems": ["In formal-logical determinism, human action is considered either rational, and hence logically explicable, or else arbitrary and random (in which case human actions can be comprehended at best only as patterns of statistical distributions, i.e. as degrees of variability relative to some constants). But in dialectical determinism, human action may be non-arbitrary and determinate, hence reasonable, even although it is not explicable exclusively in terms of deductive inference. The action selected by people from a limited range of options may not be the 'most logical' or 'most optimal' one, but it can be shown to be non-arbitrary and reasonable under the circumstances, if the total context is considered.", "What this means is that in human situations typically several 'logics' are operating at the same time which together determine the outcomes of those situations:", ["the logic of the actors themselves in their consciousness and actions;", "the logic of the given parameters constraining their behaviour; and", "the logic of the interactive (reflexive) relationship between actors and their situation."], "If one considered only one of these aspects, one might judge people's actions 'irrational', but if all three aspects are taken into account, what people do may appear 'very reasonable'. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dialectical\">Dialectical</a> theory aims to demonstrate this, by linking different 'logical levels' together as a total picture, in a non-arbitrary way. 'Different logical levels' means that particular determinants regarded as irrelevant at one level of analysis are excluded, but are relevant and included at another level of analysis with a somewhat different (or enlarged) set of assumptions depending on the kind of problem being investigated.", "For example, faced with a situation, the language which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well that at least some of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can  coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people do it all the time, and think it perfectly 'reasonable'. For another example, people will say 'you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself' or 'on the ground.' What they mean is that the meaning of the totality of interacting factors involved can only be understood by experiencing them. Standing outside the situation, things seem irrational, but being there, they appear very reasonable.", "Dialectical theory does not mean that, in analyzing the complexity of human action, inconvenient facts are simply and arbitrarily set aside. It means, rather, that those facets of the subjectmatter which are not logically required at a given stage of the analysis are set aside. Yet, and this is the point, as the analysis progresses, the previously disregarded aspects are integrated step by step into the analysis, in a consistent way. The proof of the validity of the procedure is that, at the end, the theory has made the subjectmatter fully self-explanatory, since all salient aspects have been given their appropriate place in the theory, so that all of it becomes comprehensible, without resort to shallow tautologies. This result can obviously be achieved only after the research has already been done, and the findings can be arranged in a convincing way. A synthesis cannot be achieved without a preceding analysis. So dialectical analysis is not a 'philosopher's stone' that provides a quick short-cut to the 'fount of wisdom', but a mode of presenting findings of the analysis after knowledge has been obtained through inquiry and research, and dialectical relationships have been verified. Because only then does it become clear where the story should begin and end, so that all facets are truly explained. According to Ernest Mandel, 'Marx's method is much richer than the procedures of ' successive concretization' or 'approximation' typical of academic science.'", "In mainstream social theory, the problem of 'several logics' in human action is dealt with by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Game_theory\">game theory</a>, a kind of modelling which specifies the choices and options which actors have within a defined setting, and what the effects are of their decisions. The main limitation of that approach is, that the model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based, while the choice of assumptions is often eclectic or fairly arbitrary. Dialectical theory attempts to overcome this problem, by paying attention to the sources of assumptions, and by integrating the assumptions in a consistent way."], "subsections": [{"title": "Ten implications", "sectionItems": ["Ten implications of this view are as follows:", ["At any point in time, the outcomes of an historical process are partly predetermined, and partly uncertain because they depend on what human choices and decisions will be made in the present. Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.", "While the past and the present rule out some courses of action, a human choice is always possible between a finite number of realistic options, which often enables the experienced analyst to specify the 'most likely scenarios' of what could happen in the future. Some things cannot happen, and some things are more likely to happen than others.", "Once an important choice has been made and acted upon, this will have an effect on the realm of possibilities; in particular, it will shift to a greater or lesser extent the parameters delimiting what can happen in the future. Thus, once 'a train of events has been set in motion', it will foreclose other possibilities, and also it might open up some new ones. If masses of people make important new choices, whether in response to circumstances or in response to a new idea, a qualitative change occurs; in that case, most people begin to behave differently.", "The process of history is both determined, in that the given parameters delimit the possible outcomes, but also open-ended, insofar as human action (or inaction) can change the historical outcomes within certain limits. Human history-making is therefore a reciprocal interaction between what people do, and the given circumstances.", "To some extent at least, it is possible to predict with useful accuracy what will happen in the future, if one has sufficient experience, knowledge, and insight into the relevant causal factors at work as well as how they are related. This may be a work of science or sustained practical experience. In turn, future perspectives can importantly influence human action in the present.", "In historical analysis and portrayals, the analytical challenge is to understand what part of a course of events is attributable to conscious human actions and decisions, what part is shaped by the combination of given circumstances in which the human actors had to act, and what exactly is the relationship between them (the link between the 'part' and the 'whole').", "Because the ability to prove historical assessments scientifically is limited, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ideology\">ideology</a>, a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mind-set\">mind-set</a> or a social <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mentality\">mentality</a> about the state of the world typically plays an important role in the perspectives people develop (Mandel refers here to an idea by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucien_Goldmann\">Lucien Goldmann</a>). With hindsight, it may be possible to trace out accurately why events necessarily developed in the way that they did, and not otherwise. But at the time they are happening, this is usually not, or not completely possible, and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hope\">hope</a> (or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fear\">fear</a>) for a particular future may play an important role (here Mandel refers to the philosophy of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernst_Bloch\">Ernst Bloch</a>). In addition, ideology influences whether one looks upon past events as failures or successes (as many historians have noted, history is often rewritten by the victors in great historical battles to cast themselves in an especially positive light). There is no 'non-partisan' history-writing in this sense, at best we can say the historian had full regard for the known facts pertaining to the given case and frankly acknowledges his biases.", "'History' in general cannot be simply defined as 'the past', because it is also 'the past living in the present' and 'the future living in the present'. Historical thinking is not just concerned with what past events led to the present, but also with those elements from the past which are contained in the present and elements that point to the future. It involves both antecedents and consequents, including future effects. Only on that basis can we define how people can 'make history' as a conscious <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Praxis_(process)\">praxis</a>.", "The main reason for studying history is not because we[<i>who?</i>] should assign praise or blame, or simply because it is interesting, but because we need to study past experience to understand the present and the future. History can be seen as a 'laboratory', the lab-record of which shows how, under given conditions, people tried to achieve their goals, and what the results of their experimentations were. This can provide insight into what is likely or unlikely to succeed in future. At the very least, each generation has to come to grips with the experience of the previous generation, as well as educating the future generation.", "The theory of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historicism\">historicism</a> according to which the historical process as a whole has an overall purpose or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teleology\">teleology</a> (or 'grand design') is rejected. With <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx\">Karl Marx</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels\">Friedrich Engels</a>, Mandel thought that ''History does nothing... It is people, real, living people who do all that... \u201chistory\u201d is not, as it were, a person apart, using people as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of people pursuing their aims'. With the proviso that people did so within given parameters not of their own making, allowing us to identify broad historical movements as determinate processes. The historical process is also not a matter of linear progress according to inevitable stages\u2014both progress and regress can occur, and different historical outcomes are possible depending on what people do."]], "subsections": [{"title": "Criticisms", "sectionItems": ["While Mandel himself made some successful predictions about the future of world society (for instance, he is famous for predicting at the beginning of the 1960s, like <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milton_Friedman\">Milton Friedman</a> did, that the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postwar_economic_boom\">postwar economic boom</a> would end at the close of the decade), his <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trotskyist\">Trotskyist</a> critics (including his biographer Jan Willem Stutje) argue, with the benefit of hindsight, that he was far too optimistic and hopeful about the possibility of a workers' revolution in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Europe\">Eastern Europe</a> and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union\">Soviet Union</a> during the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikhail_Gorbachev\">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> era and after\u2014and more generally, that his historical optimism distorted his political perspectives, so that he became too 'certain' about a future that he could not be so certain about, or else crucially <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ambivalence\">ambivalent</a>.", "This is arguably a rather shallow criticism insofar as the situation could well have developed in different directions, which is precisely what Mandel himself argued; in politics, one could only try to make the most of the situation at the time, and here pessimism was not conducive to action. But the more substantive criticism is that many of Mandel's future scenarios were simply not realistic, and that in reality things turned out rather differently from what he thought. This raises several questions:", ["whether the theory of parametric determinism in history is faulty;", "whether Mandel's application of the theory in his analyses was faulty;", "how much we can really foresee anyway, and what distinguishes forecast from prophecy; and", "whether and how much people learn from history anyway."], "\n\nIn answering these criticisms, Mandel himself would probably have referred to what he often called the 'laboratory of history'. That is, we can check the historical record, to see who predicted what, the grounds given for the prediction, and the results. On that basis, we can verify empirically what kind of thinking (and what kind of people) will produce the most accurate predictions, and what we can really predict with 'usable accuracy'. One reason why he favoured <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marxism\">Marxism</a> was because he believed it provided the best intellectual tools for predicting the future of society. He often cited <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leon_Trotsky\">Leon Trotsky</a> as an example of a good Marxist able to predict the future. In 1925, Trotsky wrote: ", "The essence of Marxism consists in this, that it approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research, and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record. Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man\u2019s technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature. Precisely this objective approach arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight. ", "This may all seem a trivial 'academic' or 'scholastic' debate, similar to retrospective speculations about 'what could have been different', but it has very important implications for the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Socialist\">socialist</a> idea of a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planned_economy\">planned economy</a>. Obviously, if it is not possible to predict much about human behaviour with usable accuracy, then not much economic planning is feasible either\u2014since a plan requires at least some expectation that its result can and will be realised in the future, even if the plan is regularly adjusted for new (and unanticipated) circumstances. In general, Mandel believed that the degree of predictability in human life was very much dependent on the way society itself was organised. If e.g. many producers competed with each other for profits and markets, based on privatized knowledge and business secrets, there was much unpredictability in what would happen. If the producers coordinated their efforts co-operatively, much would be predictable.", "A deeper problem, to which Mandel alludes with his book Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought, is that if we regard certain conditions as possible to change for the better, we might be able to change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible\u2014whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( a similar insight occurs in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pragmatism\">pragmatism</a>). That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing. This, however, implies that even when we try our best to be objective and realistic about history or anything else, we remain subjects influenced by subjective perceptions or elements of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fear\">fear</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hope\">hope</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Will_(philosophy)\">will</a> or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faith\">faith</a> that defy reason or practicality.", "Simply put, it is very difficult to bring scientific truths and political action together, as Marxists aim to do, in such a way that we really change the things we can change for the better to the maximum, and do not try to change things we really cannot change anyway (Marxists call this 'the unity of theory and practice'). In other words, the will to change things can involve subjective perceptions of a kind for which even the best historical knowledge may offer no assistance or guide. And all perceptions of 'history-making' may inescapably involve <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ideology\">ideology</a>, thus\u2014according to skeptics\u2014casting some doubt on the very ability of people to distinguish objectively between what can be changed, and what cannot. The boundary between the two might be rather blurry. This is the basis of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper\">Karl Popper</a>'s famous philosophy of social change by 'small steps' only.", "Mandel's reply to this skepticism essentially was to agree that there were always 'unknowns' or 'fuzzy' areas in human experience; for people to accomplish anything at all or 'make their own history', required taking a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Risk\">risk</a>, calculated or otherwise. One could indeed see one's life as a 'wager' ultimately staked on a belief, scientifically grounded or otherwise. However, he argued it was one thing to realise all that, but another to say that the 'unknowns' are 'unknowable'. Thus, for good or for ill, 'you don't know, what you haven't tried' and more specifically 'you don't know, what you haven't tried to obtain knowledge about'. The limits of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knowledge\">knowledge</a> and human possibilities could not be fixed in advance by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy\">philosophy</a>; they had to be discovered through the test of practice. This attitude recalls <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx\">Marx</a>'s famous comment that 'All social life is essentially practical. All mysteries which lead theory to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mysticism\">mysticism</a> find their rational solution in human practice, and in the comprehension of this practice.'.  Mandel believed, with Marx, that '<a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ignorance\">ignorance</a> never helped anybody' except those who profited from its existence ('never underestimate human <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gullibility\">gullibility</a>, including your own').", "The general task of revolutionary science was to overcome ignorance about human life, and this could not very well be done by reconciling people with their allegedly 'predetermined' <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Destiny\">fate</a> at every opportunity. We all know we will die eventually, but that says little yet about what we can achieve before that point. Skepticism has its uses, but what those uses are, can only be verified from experience; a universal skepticism would be just as arbitrary as the belief that 'anything is possible'\u2014it did not lead to any new experience from which something could be learnt, including learning about the possibilities of human <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freedom_of_will\">freedom</a>. And such <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Learning\">learning</a> could only occur through making conscious <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choices\">choices</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making\">decisions</a> within given parameters, i.e. in a non-arbitrary (non-chaotic) environment, permitting at least some <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predictability\">predictability</a> and allowing definite experiential conclusions.", "Mandel often reiterated that most people do not learn all that much from texts or from history, they learn from their own experience. They might be affected by history without knowing it. But anybody concerned with large-scale <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_change\">social change</a> was almost automatically confronted with the need to place matters in broader historical perspective. One had to understand deeply the limits, consequences and implications of human action. Likewise, politicians making decisions affecting large numbers of people could hardly do without a profound sense of history."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
