F.\u00a0A.\u00a0Pidgeon and Son purchased the part of the site owned by the Inchcape Group in 1982 with the intention of developing an office building in the future.

However, the adjoining Norman Wharf site owned by the State Government was unsightly and acted as a barrier between the site and the rest of the Brisbane central business district. To develop the site to its best potential it became necessary to purchase the Norman Wharf site from the State Government. The final site area was approximately 23,400 square metres (252,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) including both freehold and leasehold, and enjoyed frontages on Eagle Street, Felix Street and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Street,_Brisbane\">Mary Street</a>.", "The building became a concern in the interest of public safety in November 2007, after a window pane fell from the building's 27th storey and landed on the road below. The pane shattered before it hit the ground, narrowly missing pedestrians and cars. The pane is one of more than 200 of which that have fallen from Waterfront Place since 1990, due to an impurity of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickel_sulfide\">nickel sulfide</a> in the glass, which causes the glass to expand and shatter when it gets hot. In the mid-1990s, more than 300 windows containing the impurity were replaced in the building, however it is understood that there are still more windows with the defect. Following the 2007 incident, additional awnings were constructed across Felix Street to prevent falling window panes from landing on vehicles and pedestrians, and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marina\">marina</a> in the Brisbane River has been dismantled.", "The building's two-level carpark was completely flooded during the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010\u201311_Queensland_floods\">2011 Brisbane flood</a> and the whole building was inaccessible for a week."], "subsections": [{"title": "Office floors", "sectionItems": ["Typical floor size ranges from approximately 1,816 to 1,867 square metres (19,550 to 20,100\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).
