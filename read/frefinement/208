Predictive techniques, such as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Forecasting\">forecasting</a>, can be applied, but contemporary futures studies scholars emphasize the importance of systematically exploring alternatives. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_science\">social sciences</a> and an extension to the field of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/History\">history</a>. Futures studies (colloquially called '<b>futures</b>' by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change.

There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science, and it is sometimes described as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudoscience\">pseudoscience</a>; nevertheless, the Association of Professional Futurists was formed in 2002, developing a Foresight Competency Model in 2017, and it is now possible to academically study it, for example at the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FU_Berlin\">FU Berlin</a> in their master's course."], "subsections": [{"title": "Methodologies", "sectionItems": ["In terms of methodology, futures practitioners employ a wide range of approaches, models and methods, in both theory and practice, many of which are derived from or informed by other academic or professional disciplines [1], including social sciences such as economics, psychology, sociology, religious studies, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science; physical and life sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology; mathematics, including statistics, game theory and econometrics; applied disciplines such as engineering, computer sciences, and business management (particularly strategy).", "The largest internationally peer-reviewed collection of futures research methods (1,300 pages) is Futures Research Methodology 3.0. Each of the 37 methods or groups of methods contains: an executive overview of each method's history, description of the method, primary and alternative usages, strengths and weaknesses, uses in combination with other methods, and speculation about future evolution of the method. Some also contain appendixes with applications, links to software, and sources for further information.", "Given its unique objectives and material, the practice of futures studies only rarely features employment of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scientific_method\">scientific method</a> in the sense of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing from history, the futurist might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing from technology, the futurist may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.", "As the plural term 'futures' suggests, one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular.[2] That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be 'predicted', but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term 'futures' in futures studies denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.", "At present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with 'three Ps and a W', or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_card_(Foresight_research)\">wildcards</a>, which are unexpected, seemingly low probability but high impact events (positive or negative). Many futurists do not use the wild card approach. Rather, they use a methodology called <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emerging_issues_analysis\">emerging issues analysis</a>. It searches for the drivers of change, issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known, from low impact to high impact.", "In terms of technique, futures practitioners originally concentrated on <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Extrapolation\">extrapolating</a> present <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Technological\">technological</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economic\">economic</a> or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social\">social</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fads_and_trends\">trends</a>, or on attempting to predict future trends. Over time, the discipline has come to put more and more focus on the examination of social <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/System\">systems</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uncertainty\">uncertainties</a>, to the end of articulating <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scenario_planning\">scenarios</a>. The practice of scenario development facilitates the examination of worldviews and assumptions through the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causal_layered_analysis\">causal layered analysis</a> method (and others), the creation of preferred visions of the future, and the use of exercises such as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Backcasting\">backcasting</a> to connect the present with alternative futures. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research (see below).", "Therefore, the general practice of futures studies also sometimes includes the articulation of normative or preferred futures, and a major thread of practice involves connecting both extrapolated (exploratory) and normative research to assist individuals and organizations to model preferred futures amid shifting social changes. For instance, despite many wicked, global challenges in today's world from climate change to extreme poverty, the aspect of preferability or 'what should happen' can at times be overlooked. Practitioners use varying proportions of collaboration, creativity and research to derive and define alternative futures, and to the degree that a 'preferred' future might be sought, especially in an organizational context, techniques may also be deployed to develop plans or strategies for directed future shaping or implementation of a preferred future.", "While some futurists are not concerned with assigning probability to future scenarios, other futurists find probabilities useful in certain situations, such as when probabilities stimulate thinking about scenarios within organizations [3]. When dealing with the three Ps and a W model, estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns (discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events), while considering the range of possible futures, recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures, characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future, and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship. Most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative, though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods (technology and information growth curves, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cliometrics\">cliometrics</a>, predictive psychology, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prediction_market\">prediction markets</a>, crowd-voting forecasts,[31][<i>better source needed</i>] etc.) has been made in recent decades."], "subsections": [{"title": "Futures techniques", "sectionItems": ["Futures techniques or methodologies may be viewed as 'frameworks for making sense of data generated by structured processes to think about the future'.

This focus is especially important to note because it is often difficult to persuade people to accept something they do not believe is happening, until they see the wild card.  An example is climate change.  This hypothesis has gone from Type I (high impact and high credibility, but low probability where science was accepted and thought unlikely to happen) to Type II (high probability, high impact, but low credibility as policy makers and lobbyists push back against the science), to Type III (high probability, high impact, high credibility)\u2014at least for most people,  There are still some who probably will not accept the science until the Greenland ice sheet has completely melted and sea-level has risen the seven meters estimated rise.", "This concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred. Sometimes, mistakenly, wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms, which they are not. One of the most often cited examples of a wild card event in recent history is 9/11. Nothing had happened in the past that could point to such a possibility and yet it had a huge impact on everyday life in the United States, from simple tasks like how to travel via airplane to deeper cultural values. Wild card events might also be natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which can force the relocation of huge populations and wipe out entire crops or completely disrupt the supply chain of many businesses.
