He continued to work as a factory worker in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murom\">Murom</a> even as he deepened his involvement in political activism, and in 1904 he was arrested for distribution of illegal literature. Shliapnikov managed to convince the prosecutor that he had been entrapped by police provocateurs, and thus won his freedom, but also attracted the attention of the local Black Hundreds, who brutally assaulted him on his way home. Undeterred, Shliapnikov continued his revolutionary activities, and during the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Revolution_of_1905\">1905 revolution</a>, he led an armed demonstration of workers in Murom, helping to take the local police chief hostage and force the police to retreat, resulting in another arrest. Even after being freed by the general amnesty issued in October, his continued militancy and intransigence saw him jailed for a third time, in a prison stint which would last until January 1907. Almost immediately after his release, Shliapnikov was drafted into the army, and after refusing to take an oath of loyalty to the Tsar, the police once again arrested him. Freed on bail, he vanished into the underground, finding work in the Electrical Station of 1886 in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Petersburg\">St. Petersburg</a>, where he met fellow metalworker <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sergei_Medvedev_(revolutionary)\">Sergei Medvedev</a>, establishing what would become a decades long friendship. Later in 1907, the now 22-year-old Shliapnikov became a member of the Petersburg Committee of the RSDRP(b), and due to his growing prominence, at the end of 1907 his friends advised him to emigrate from Russia. Entrusted with letters for Bolshevik leader <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin\">Vladimir Lenin</a>, he left Russia in January 1908, and after arriving in Switzerland by February 6, where he had a brief meeting with Lenin, continued onwards to Paris, and within two months Shliapnikov found work in an automobile factory in the suburb of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine\">Asni\u00e8res</a>."], "subsections": [{"title": "Works", "sectionItems": [["Shliapnikov, AG (1989) [1927\u201329], 'Avtobiografiia',  in Gambarov, Iu S (ed.), <i>\u0414\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0438 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u0438: \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0438 (Deiateli SSSR i oktiabr'skoi revoliutsii: avtobiografii i biografii)</i> [<i>Figures of the USSR and the October Revolution: autobiography and biography</i>] (in Russian), vol.\u00a03, et al.
