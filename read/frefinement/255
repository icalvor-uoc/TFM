It took place in 479 BC near the city of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plataea\">Plataea</a> in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotia\">Boeotia</a>, and was fought between an alliance of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece\">Greek</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/City-state\">city-states</a> (including <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta\">Sparta</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Athens\">Athens</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinth\">Corinth</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Megara\">Megara</a>), and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire\">Persian Empire</a> of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I\">Xerxes I</a> (allied with Greece's <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeotians\">Boeotians</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessalians\">Thessalians</a>, and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)\">Macedonians</a>).", "The previous year the Persian invasion force, led by the Persian king in person, had scored victories at the battles of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae\">Thermopylae</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Artemisium\">Artemisium</a> and conquered <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly\">Thessaly</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phocis\">Phocis</a>, Boeotia, Euboea and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attica\">Attica</a>. However, at the ensuing <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Salamis\">Battle of Salamis</a>, the allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnesus\">Peloponnesus</a>. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardonius_(nephew_of_Darius_I)\">Mardonius</a> to finish off the Greeks the following year.", "In the summer of 479\u00a0BC the Greeks assembled a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused to be drawn into the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks were in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infantry\">infantry</a> and killing Mardonius.", "A large portion of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Mycale\">Battle of Mycale</a>, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greco-Persian_Wars\">Greco-Persian Wars</a>. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Marathon\">Battle of Marathon</a> or the allied Greek <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae\">defeat at Thermopylae</a>."], "subsections": [{"title": "Accounts of individuals", "sectionItems": ["Herodotus recounts several anecdotes about the conduct of specific Spartans during the battle.", ["<b><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amompharetus\">Amompharetus</a></b>: The leader of a battalion of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon the rest of the Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.", "<b><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristodemus_(Spartan)\">Aristodemus</a></b>: The lone Spartan survivor of the slaughter of the 300 at the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Thermopylae\">Battle of Thermopylae</a> had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonidas_I\">Leonidas I</a> because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed to fight in the disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.", "<b>Callicrates</b>: Considered the 'most beautiful man, not among the Spartans only, but in the whole Greek camp', Callicrates was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior but was deprived of the chance by a stray arrow that pierced his side while standing in formation. When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, 'I grieve not because I have to die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy.'"], "Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an ancestor of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp with a warning that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued a challenge to the Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined.
