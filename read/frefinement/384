Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balkans\">Balkans</a> and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea\">Aegean</a>. In fact, Europe celebrated Mehmed coming to the throne and hoped his inexperience would lead the Ottomans astray. This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.:\u200a373\u200a But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by his actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fortress\">fortress</a> (<i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumelihisar\u0131\">Rumeli hisar\u0131</a></i>) on the European side of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosphorus\">Bosphorus</a>, several miles north of Constantinople.

This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosporus\">Bosphorus</a>:\u200a373\u200a and defended against attack by the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genoa\">Genoese</a> colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. In fact, the new fortress was called <i>Bo\u011fazkesen</i>, which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter'. The wordplay emphasizes its strategic position: in Turkish <i>bo\u011faz</i> means both 'strait' and 'throat'. In October 1452, Mehmed ordered <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turakhan_Beg\">Turakhan Beg</a> to station a large garrison force in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese\">Peloponnese</a> to block <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Palaiologos\">Thomas</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demetrios_Palaiologos\">Demetrios</a> (<a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Despotes\">despotes</a> in Southern <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece\">Greece</a>) from providing aid to their brother <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos\">Constantine XI Palaiologos</a> during the impending siege of Constantinople. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karaca_Pasha\">Karaca Pasha</a>, the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beylerbey\">beylerbeyi</a> of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumelia_Eyalet\">Rumelia</a>, sent men to prepare the roads from <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edirne\">Adrianople</a> to Constantinople so that bridges could cope with the massive cannons.

You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me.
