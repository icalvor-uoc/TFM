As the national federation narrowly voted against, another vote was held in 1908, by which time SWMF members voted 74,675 to 44,616 in favour.

They varied greatly in size, and those with more than 3,000 members were entitled to an automatic place on the union's executive, plus an extra place for each additional 6,000 members.  Each district held a monthly meeting, comprising one delegate from each lodge, and was led by a district executive.  Each district elected at least one agent, who then served until they chose to retire, thus making the role hugely important.", "The number of districts gradually increased, to a peak of twenty, then with the abolition to the tiny Saundersfoot district, continued at nineteen until 1934.  By this point, most districts were struggling financially, and so a complete restructure took place.  The districts were replaced by eight areas, employing one or more agents, but otherwise much less important, governance moving to the level of the combine or lodge.", "These were gradually reduced, and by 1979 only five districts existed:", ["Aberdare, Rhondda and Merthyr", "Maesteg", "Monmouthshire", "Rhymney", "Swansea"], "Over the years, there were a few splits from the union.
