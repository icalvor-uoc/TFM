The Northover Projector was designed by Home Guard officer Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom\">Prime Minister</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a>.", "The weapon consisted of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end.
