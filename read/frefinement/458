Its <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Specific_name_(zoology)\">specific epithet</a> <i>delicatus</i> is <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin\">Latin</a> for 'delicate', referring to the fine <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teeth\">teeth</a> on its saw-like <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rostrum_(anatomy)\">rostrum</a>.", "This is a small species; the maximum known length is 85\u00a0cm (33\u00a0in) for females and 63\u00a0cm (25\u00a0in) for males (although no mature males have yet been examined). The body is slender with a circular cross-section, and depressed forward of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gill_slit\">gill slits</a>. The elongated, saw-like snout tapers evenly to its tip, and bears very slender lateral <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teeth\">teeth</a> of variable length and a pair of filamentous, dorsoventrally flattened <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbel_(anatomy)\">barbels</a>. The <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eyes\">eyes</a> are large and oval in shape. Its nostrils about one-third the distance from the corner of the mouth to the barbel attachment on the rostrum. The <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth\">mouth</a> is large and broadly arched; there are 47 tooth rows in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Upper_jaw\">upper jaw</a> and 37 in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lower_jaw\">lower</a>. The teeth have flattened, oval bases and a single narrow, pointed <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cusp_(dentistry)\">cusp</a>. The <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pectoral_fin\">pectoral fins</a> are large with narrowed rounded tips and weakly concave rear margins. The two <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorsal_fin\">dorsal fins</a> are well-separated, the first longer and broader than the second. The <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caudal_fin\">caudal fin</a> is short, with the lower lobe absent.", "The coloration is medium brown above and white below; there are pronounced white rear margins on the dorsal and caudal fins. The paired fins are mostly pale with brownish basal portions clearly demarcated from the rest of the fin. Very little is known of the biology of the tropical sawshark; its small size may indicate that it is reproductively productive. There is little fishing pressure within its range, and so it is classified as of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Least_Concern\">Least Concern</a> by the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Conservation_Union\">World Conservation Union</a>."], "subsections": []}}
