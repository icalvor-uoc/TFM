On March 8, 1890, a motion carried in the <i>Alpha</i> of Zeta Phi to become a chapter of Beta Theta Pi pursuant to several special conditions. The petition was granted by the General Fraternity at its convention in the summer of 1890. As noted in the minutes, the conditions were as follows:", ["'That we be known as the <i>Zeta Phi chapter</i> of Beta Theta Pi.'", "'That all active members of this chapter be initiated, and that all alumni of this chapter be admitted into full membership of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity upon acknowledging allegiance to its constitution.'", "'That the active members of this chapter be the sole judges of the new men who shall be initiated into the chapter.'"], "The changeover ceremony from a <i>society</i> to a <i>chapter</i>, and the initiation, when all alumni of the society and actives at the university were accepted as Betas, took place at Stone Hall. Following the ceremony, the group adjourned downstairs to what was known as O'Rear's Oyster Parlor for a banquet.", "The Mizzou group apparently continued to meet on a regular basis in the Union Literary Building, now as a Beta chapter, and in 1895, began a fund toward the purchase of a chapter house. In 1901, the chapter rented accommodations and began living together for the first time in a two-story rental house at 201 South Ninth Street. The fund for a permanent house continued to grow, however, and in late 1904, only a few months after the formation of the Zeta Phi corporation, a spacious three-story frame house was completed at 714 Missouri Avenue at a cost of $9,000. The chapter lived in the house, one of the first of such permanent facilities on campus, from 1905 until 1912.", "On New Year's Day of the latter year, however, tragedy struck when the building caught fire and burned to the ground. Within months, plans were made for the construction of a larger new house, this one to be built of brick and mortar. A fund drive was started and the monies raised, along with a substantial insurance recovery from the loss of the previous house, enabled the chapter to occupy new premises in 1913 with only a modest mortgage. The chapter's new address, 520 South College Avenue, occupied a site formerly owned by the Kappa Sigma fraternity and the new building with its gabled roof stood out within the Missouri Greek system.", "In September 1917, the District Chiefs of the General Fraternity met with the trustees of Beta Theta Pi at the International Hotel in Niagara Falls, New York. Their purpose was to decide which chapter of the fraternity would be awarded the first Sisson Trophy. The initial award, which had been established only months before, was an honor to be bestowed on the top chapter in the general fraternity. After a full discussion of a number of chapters, the Chiefs made the following recommendations to the Board, which were recorded in the minutes:", "'The District Chiefs have carefully considered the claims of the several chapters to the Sisson Trophy, to be awarded this year for the first time. They have noted with extreme gratification that, in spite of the disturbed conditions of the past year, several chapters have been considered worthy of this honor. It is the opinion of the Chiefs that the Sisson Trophy, which is to go to the chapter which most nearly approximates the ideal chapter of the fraternity, be awarded to the Missouri chapter, and we do so recommend.'"], "subsections": []}, {"title": "Awards", "sectionItems": [["Four men of the <i>Zeta Phi chapter</i> (Mizzou) have won the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhodes_Scholarship\">Rhodes Scholarship</a>", "John Reily Knox Chapter Excellence Award", "Francis H.
