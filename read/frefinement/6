Along with other Adventist leaders such as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Bates_(Adventist)\">Joseph Bates</a> and her husband <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Springer_White\">James White</a>, she was instrumental within a small group of early Adventists who formed what became known as the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church\">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>. White is considered a leading figure in American vegetarian history. <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smithsonian_(magazine)\">Smithsonian</a></i> named her among the '100 Most Significant Americans of All Time'.", "White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/God_in_Christianity\">God</a> in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption the content of each <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vision_(spirituality)\">vision</a>. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spiritual_gift\">Biblical gift of prophecy</a> as outlined in Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 19:10, which describe the testimony of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus\">Jesus</a> as the 'spirit of prophecy.'

Historian <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randall_Balmer\">Randall Balmer</a> has described White as 'one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion'. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Ralston_Martin\">Walter Martin</a> described her as 'one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history'. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_L._White\">Arthur L.
