The term is used in the context of resistance that <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pathogen\">pathogens</a> or cancers have 'acquired', that is, resistance has evolved. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antimicrobial_resistance\">Antimicrobial resistance</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antineoplastic_resistance\">antineoplastic resistance</a> challenge clinical care and drive research. When an organism is resistant to more than one drug, it is said to be <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiple_drug_resistance\">multidrug-resistant</a>.", "The development of antibiotic resistance in particular stems from the drugs targeting only specific bacterial molecules (almost always proteins). Because the drug is <i>so</i> specific, any mutation in these molecules will interfere with or negate its destructive effect, resulting in antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, there is mounting concern over the abuse of antibiotics in the farming of livestock, which in the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Union\">European Union</a> alone accounts for three times the volume dispensed to humans \u2013 leading to development of super-resistant bacteria.", "Bacteria are capable of not only altering the enzyme targeted by antibiotics, but also by the use of enzymes to modify the antibiotic itself and thus neutralize it. Examples of target-altering pathogens are <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staphylococcus_aureus\">Staphylococcus aureus</a></i>, vancomycin-resistant <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enterococci\">enterococci</a> and macrolide-resistant <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Streptococcus\">Streptococcus</a></i>, while examples of antibiotic-modifying microbes are <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa\">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></i> and aminoglycoside-resistant <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acinetobacter_baumannii\">Acinetobacter baumannii</a></i>.", "In short, the lack of concerted effort by governments and the pharmaceutical industry, together with the innate capacity of microbes to develop resistance at a rate that outpaces development of new drugs, suggests that existing strategies for developing viable, long-term anti-microbial therapies are ultimately doomed to failure. Without alternative strategies, the acquisition of drug resistance by pathogenic microorganisms looms as possibly one of the most significant public health threats facing humanity in the 21st century. Some of the best alternative sources to reduce the chance of antibiotic resistance are probiotics, prebiotics, dietary fibers, enzymes, organic acids, phytogenics."], "subsections": [{"title": "Mechanisms", "sectionItems": ["The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:", ["Drug inactivation or modification: e.g., enzymatic deactivation of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penicillin\"><i>Penicillin</i> G</a> in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beta-lactamases\">\u03b2-lactamases</a>.", "Alteration of target site: e.g., alteration of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penicillin-binding_protein\">PBP</a> \u2014 the binding target site of penicillins \u2014 in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus\">MRSA</a> and other penicillin-resistant bacteria.", "Alteration of metabolic pathway: e.g., some <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulfa_drugs\">sulfonamide</a>-resistant bacteria do not require <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Para-aminobenzoic_acid\">para-aminobenzoic acid</a> (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folic_acid\">folic acid</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nucleic_acids\">nucleic acids</a> in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides.
