A random sequence of events, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symbol\">symbols</a> or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are, by definition, unpredictable, but if the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability_distribution\">probability distribution</a> is known, the frequency of different outcomes over repeated events (or 'trials') is predictable. For example, when throwing two <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dice\">dice</a>, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will tend to occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is not haphazardness; it is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome. Randomness applies to concepts of chance, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability\">probability</a>, and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Information_entropy\">information entropy</a>.", "The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of randomness. In statistics, a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_variable\">random variable</a> is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Event_space\">event space</a>. This association facilitates the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random variables can appear in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_sequence\">random sequences</a>. A <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_process\">random process</a> is a sequence of random variables whose outcomes do not follow a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Determinism\">deterministic</a> pattern, but follow an evolution described by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability_distribution\">probability distributions</a>. These and other constructs are extremely useful in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability_theory\">probability theory</a> and the various <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Applications_of_randomness\">applications of randomness</a>.", "Randomness is most often used in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statistics\">statistics</a> to signify well-defined statistical properties. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monte_Carlo_method\">Monte Carlo methods</a>, which rely on random input (such as from <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_number_generation\">random number generators</a> or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudorandom_number_generator\">pseudorandom number generators</a>), are important techniques in science, particularly in the field of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scientific_computing\">computational science</a>. By analogy, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method\">quasi-Monte Carlo methods</a> use <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Low-discrepancy_sequence\">quasi-random number generators</a>.", "<b>Random selection</b>, when narrowly associated with a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simple_random_sample\">simple random sample</a>, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population. For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10. Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen, then we can say the selection process is random.", "According to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ramsey_theory\">Ramsey theory</a>, pure randomness is impossible, especially for large structures. Mathematician <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Motzkin\">Theodore Motzkin</a> suggested that 'while disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is impossible'. Misunderstanding this can lead to numerous <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conspiracy_theory\">conspiracy theories</a>. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cristian_S._Calude\">Cristian S.
