The tradition was maintained at <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wychnor_Hall\">Wychnor Hall</a> in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staffordshire\">Staffordshire</a>  until at least the eighteenth century, but now the flitch required to be held remains only as a carving over the fireplace.  At <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Little_Dunmow\">Little Dunmow</a> in Essex a similar ceremony also survived into the eighteenth century.  The tradition can be traced back to at least the fourteenth century at both sites and the Dunmow flitch is referred to in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaucer\">Chaucer</a>.  The awarding of a flitch at both sites seems to have been an exceedingly rare event.", "The Dunmow tradition was revived in Victorian times, largely inspired by a book (<i>The Flitch of Bacon</i>) by <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Harrison_Ainsworth\">William Harrison Ainsworth</a>.  Flitch trials are still held in modern times at <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Dunmow\">Great Dunmow</a>.  A <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counsel\">counsel</a> is employed to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cross-examination\">cross-examine</a> the nominated couples and attempt to show they are undeserving of the award.", "There is evidence that the flitch of bacon tradition existed outside Britain in mainland Europe and some would push its origins back as far as Saxon times.
