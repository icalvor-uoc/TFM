The fact that it is 2 discs shows the amount of music Mac Dre put out during his short life. Though he never hit the mainstream quite as large as some other West Coast artists, his songs have influenced many other Bay Area artists and have inspired cultural phenomenons such as the 'Hyphy Movement' and 'Thizz Dance'. His music always kept true to himself and rightfully earned him as one of the Godfathers of Bay Area Hip Hop."], "subsections": [{"title": "Track listing", "sectionItems": [], "subsections": [{"title": "Disc 1", "sectionItems": [["Too Hard", "Nuthin But Love", "All Damn Day", "Its Nothin ", "Hoe We Like ", "Rapper Gone Bad", "X.O.
