SEDs use nanoscopic-scale <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electron\">electron</a> emitters to energize colored <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phosphor\">phosphors</a> and produce an image. In a general sense, a SED consists of a matrix of tiny <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathode-ray_tube\">cathode-ray tubes</a>, each 'tube' forming a single sub-pixel on the screen, grouped in threes to form red-green-blue (RGB) <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pixel\">pixels</a>. SEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contrast_ratio\">contrast ratios</a>, wide <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viewing_angle\">viewing angles</a>, and very fast <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Response_time_(technology)\">response times</a>, with the packaging advantages of LCD and other flat panel displays.
