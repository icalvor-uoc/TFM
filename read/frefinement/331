He took an early idea of a jet engine falling onto a house with no one knowing its origin and built the story around it. Kelly insisted on directing the film himself and struggled to secure backing from producers until 2000, when Barrymore's <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower_Films\">Flower Films</a> agreed to produce it on a $4.5 million budget. Filming took 28 days in the summer of 2000, mostly in California.

Because the film's advertising featured a crashing plane and the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks\">September 11 attacks</a> had occurred a month and a half before, it was scarcely advertised, which affected its box office performance; it grossed just $517,375 in its initial run. <i>Donnie Darko</i> received positive reviews and was listed No.\u00a02 in <i><a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_(magazine)\">Empire</a></i>'s '50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time', and No.\u00a053 in <i>Empire</i>'s '500 Greatest Movies of All Time'.
