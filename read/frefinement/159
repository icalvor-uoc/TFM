Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding explained that Watts had wanted to include a suit inspired by the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider-Man_Noir\">Spider-Man Noir</a> version of the character, which led to the design of the more tactical stealth suit. He added that the suit represents Parker experimenting with being a new kind of superhero. Other tactical costumes from the comic books were looked at when developing this one, but Meinerding felt they looked less practical than the more straightforward Noir inspiration. The costume includes tactical goggles that can be flipped up. For Parker's new self-designed costume, Meinerding originally designed it with the idea that it would be made from Parker's webbing since that is the strongest material he has access to. Practical versions of the costumes were created by Ironhead Studio, who previously worked on <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(film_series)\"><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> films</a>.
