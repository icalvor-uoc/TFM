When appointed as engineer to the South Staffordshire Railway, under constriction at the time in October 1846, he was already working for four other railway companies. Earlier, when apprenticed to a firm of civil engineers in London, he had prepared surveys and detailed drawings for the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_Embankment\">Victoria Embankment</a> and the new <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Bridge\">Westminster Bridge</a>.

McClean observed that <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lichfield\">Lichfield's</a> water was clean and pure; he secured the agreement of some powerful friends, including the Earl of Dudley, and the South Staffordshire Waterworks Company was formed in 1853. The company supplied Walsall and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dudley\">Dudley</a> with Lichfield water, using Stowe and Minster pools as reservoirs. The pipe run was intalled alongside the railway. Parts of Walsall were connected by 1858 but it took fifteen years to complete the scheme. McClean was engineer to the waterworks company, but drew no salary.", "After an Act of Parliament was passed to allow it, he took a 25-year lease on the railway, thus becoming the first person ever to be the sole owner of a railway.", "By 1853 he was also busying himself with mining, completing a railway line serving two of the Marquis of Anglesey's pits on <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannock_Chase\">Cannock Chase</a>, known then as the Hammerwich and Uxbridge pits, known more recently as Cannock Chase Colliery Nos. 1 and 2.", "Money invested by McClean, the Marquis and others helped to develop the Cannock Chase coalfield. The pits spawned the new communities of Chasetown and Chase Terrace, which were provided with schools, churches, a community centre and library by McClean.
