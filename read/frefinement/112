According to Malhotra: ", "Many eminent Indian-American donors are being led down the garden path by Indian professors who, ironically, assemble a team of scholars to undermine Indian culture.

According to Malhotra, Indian-American donors were 'hoodwinked' into thinking that they were supporting India through their monetary contributions to such programmes. Malhotra compares the defence of Indian interests with corporate brand management, distrusting the loyalties of Indian scholars:", "Therefore, it is critical that we do not blindly assume that Indian scholars are always honest trustees of the Indian-American donors' sentiments. Many Indian scholars are weak in the pro-India leadership and assertiveness traits that come only from strongly identifying with an Indian Grand Narrative.\nThey regard the power of Grand Narrative (other than their own) as a cause of human rights problems internally, failing to see it as an asset in global competition externally. Hence, there is the huge difference between the ideology of many Indian professors and the ideology espoused by most successful Indian-American corporate leaders.", "According to Malhotra, a positive stance on India has been under-represented in American academia, due to programmes being staffed by Westerners, their 'Indian-American Sepoys' and Indian Americans wanting to be white \u2014 whom he disparages as 'career opportunists' and 'Uncle Toms' who 'in their desire to become even marginal members of the Western Grand Narrative sneer at Indian culture in the same manner as colonialists once did'.

According to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shreena_Niketa_Gandhi\">Shreena Gandhi</a>, professor of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_studies\">Religious studies</a> at <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan_State_University\">Michigan State University</a>, many American Yoga teachers do not learn about <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hinduism\">Hinduism</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture_of_India\">Indian culture</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoga_(philosophy)\">spiritual philosophies of Yoga</a>. So, only far few American teachers go much deeper than mere physical forms or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asana\">Asanas</a>, hence they dilute the true depth and philosophies of Yoga. Most Western Yoga teachers, states Malhotra, mentions <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pranayama\">Pranayama</a>, <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Om\">chanting Om</a> or <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asana\">Asanas</a> as health-related components of modern Yoga, yet this attitude is based, at best, a shallow or lack of understanding of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dharma\">Yoga'a Dharmic roots</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_philosophy\">philosophy</a>.", "The <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Om\">practice of Om</a> as a <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantra\">sacred utterance</a> is designed to dissolve <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Namarupa\">Namarupa</a> from the mind, that is the whole idea and the principle behind the Mantra. Its universality lies in its ability to transcend all particular historic contexts. The names 'Jesus', 'Allah', or 'Amen' are proper nouns laden with historic context and aren't a synonym for a Mantra which have a specific <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transcendence_(religion)\">transcendental context</a>. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patanjali\">Patanjali</a> mentions <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Om\">Om</a> as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nididhy\u0101sana\">Vacakah</a> or vibration of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ishvara\">Ishvara</a>, hence the experience it brings cannot be generated by an alternative sound such as the sound or names of other God. Yoga and Hinduism are deeply coupled, and renaming the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanskrit\">original Sanskrit terms</a> doesn't do any favor, since the actual physical practices, in the case of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asana\">asanas</a> remains the same, states Malhotra. Swami Param, head of Classical Yoga Academy in <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manahawkin,_New_Jersey\">Manahawkin, New Jersey</a>, states that 'If people could not acknowledge the Hindu elements and roots of Yoga, they should not bother studying it.' He further adds, 'As Hindus, we have no problem studying other religions, but we give them the respect they deserve.'", "Yoga's metaphysics centers around the quest to attain <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moksha\">liberation</a> from one's conditioning caused by the past <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karma\">Karma</a>.

Malhotra points out, while it's 'fashionable' for Westerners to say that, they believe in Karma and reincarnation, they have seldom worked out the contradictions with <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_theology\">core Biblical doctrines</a>. Yogic liberation is therefore not contingent upon any unique historic events or interventions. <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jiva\">Every individual's</a> <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/\u0100tman_(Hinduism)\">ultimate essence</a> is <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satcitananda\">Sat-Cit-Ananda</a>, Originally Divine, and not Originally Sinful by birth, Malhotra indicates this very fundamental contradiction of the doctrines of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Original_sin\">Original sin</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicene_Creed\">Nicene Creed</a>.", "Malhotra further claims that Dharmic traditions are misunderstood by the West, one being the scholars conflated the use of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_iconography\">Dharmic images</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_deities\">deities</a> with <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paganism\">pre-Christian Peganism</a>, although Paganism is quite different from <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhakti\">Dharmic bhakti</a>. This suspicion of idolatry is one of the greatest obstacles which the Western practitioners of Yoga face, states Malhotra. The negative and erroneous association of Yoga with an idolatry of the body gives rise to odd hybrids such as Christian Yoga or Jewish Yoga or, Muslim Yoga, who claim to provide a cleaned-up Yoga, which is free from dangers of idolatry. He adds, internalized taboos, social prejudices, and all stereotypes of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_religions\">Dharmic culture</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hinduism\">Hinduism</a> in particular, act as a filter in the interpretation of <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_India\">Dharmic traditions</a>, such as <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoga\">Yoga</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dhy\u0101na_in_Hinduism\">meditation</a> to create varied responses to Yoga.", "Although few Christian Yoga or 'Secular' Yoga practitioners make baseless claims, states Malhotra, such as 'Yoga doesn't belong to Hinduism' or 'Yoga isn't Hindu', he asserts that, such people neither understands the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoga_(philosophy)\">philosophy Yoga</a> nor its relation to <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hinduism\">Hinduism</a>. It's a fact of the matter that <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoga\">Yoga</a> is one of the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_philosophy\">six major orthodox schools of Hinduism</a> (<a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/\u0100stika_and_n\u0101stika\">\u0100stika</a>), hence those preconceived claims are factually incorrect.
