Acquiring land through donations, transfers from Multnomah County, and delinquent tax <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreclosure\">foreclosures</a>, the city eventually acted on a proposal by the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_Club_of_Portland\">City Club of Portland</a> and combined parcels totaling about 4,000 acres (1,600\u00a0ha) to create the reserve.

About 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm) of rain falls on the forest each year.
