{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "City Airport & Manchester Heliport: History\nAutumn 1928: Construction of Manchester's new municipal aerodrome at Barton, near Eccles started, to replace the temporary Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome.\nJanuary 1930: The grass airfield and large hangar were completed. The first passenger charter flight occurred. Barton was managed until 1933 by Northern Air Lines, who based several Avro 504s and other types for training, club and charter flights.\nSummer 1930: Imperial Airways operated a thrice-weekly scheduled service to London's Croydon Airport via Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, Birmingham, subsidised by the councils of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham. This service was timed to fly north from Croydon in the evening and to return south next morning, in order to provide connections to and from European airports from Croydon.\nSpring 1933: A control tower and associated wireless station were completed, the first at a municipal airport outside London, and able to communicate with aircraft in flight and give pilots bearings from the airfield. The tower is still operational and is believed to be the oldest in Europe still in use for its original purpose.\nAugust 1934: Scheduled services resumed. Croydon-based Railway Air Services commenced a Croydon-Barton-Belfast-Glasgow route.\nSpring 1935: Linking services to Liverpool, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were introduced. Other smaller airlines, including Isle of Man Air Services operated services from Barton.\nJune 1938: All schedules were transferred to the newly completed larger Ringway Airport (which between 1940 and 1957 also accommodated RAF Ringway).\nWorld War II: Barton was requisitioned and used for military aircraft repair and overhaul, carried out by civilian firms including Air Taxis Ltd and David Rosenfield Ltd.  Aircraft types involved were Avro Ansons, Dominies, Fairey Battles, Fairey Fulmars, Hawker Hurricanes and F4U Corsairs, followed by the scrapping of Fairey Swordfish. Over 700 Percival Proctor training and communications aircraft were assembled and tested at Barton by F. Hills & Sons of Trafford Park. There is a wartime concrete air raid bunker still at the site hidden under overgrown vegetation near the main road (A57).\n1940\u20131942: The sole wartime scheduled air service from Ireland to the UK occasionally used Barton from 1940 to 1942, operated from Dublin by Aer Lingus and West Coast Air Services. Aer Lingus often used their Douglas DC-3, the heaviest airliner type to serve Barton on a timetabled route. This was the last scheduled service though the airfield.\n1946: Lancashire Aero Club moved from Woodford Aerodrome to Barton and remain based there until 2007.\n1946 to 1953: Manchester University Air Squadron (MUAS) was based in one of the wartime-built western hangars. In 1953 the unit moved to RAF Woodvale near Southport, Lancashire. MUAS had flown Tiger Moth and Chipmunk trainers.\n1 October 1948 to 31 March 1953:  No.2 Reserve Flying School, also flying Tiger Moths and Chipmunks, was based at Barton and gave primary flight training to volunteers, who would later serve in the Royal Air Force. The unit used the same facilities as MUAS. On 31 March 1953 the unit closed.\n21 July 1996: The last known airworthy de Havilland Mosquito, a Trainer Mk III built by de Havilland at Leavesden in early 1945 (serial number RR299), crashed with the loss of both crew after suffering engine power loss when performing a wing-over manoeuvre during the Barton Aerodrome air show.\n2003: Manchester Ship Canal Developments, (of which Peel Holdings Group is the majority shareholder), bought the land, hangars and other buildings from Manchester City Council.\nNovember 2003\u00a0: Peel Investments (North) Limited submit an initial planning application, requesting permission to build the Western Gateway Infrastructure Scheme (WGIS) to the south of the A57 road, opposite the airfield (see Port Salford). One feature of the proposal is a new rail spur running along the eastern boundary of the airfield.\nMay 2004\u00a0: Initial consultations with parties likely to be affected by WGIS.\n2006: The control tower underwent a major programme of rebuilding and refurbishment.\n2007: Lancashire Aero Club left the airfield after a dispute with Peel Holdings.\n2010: City Airport Ltd no longer part of Peel Airports. Airfield Management Company now fully part of Peel Holdings.\n2010: The Original Hangar (known as The Pemberton Hangar), a Grade II listed building, long used as a warehouse for timber and sheet walling materials, underwent a full refurbishment.\n2011: Former University of Manchester building converted into a new Helicopter facility, branded as City Heliport. Peel established Cardinal Helicopter Services, a premium Helicopter Charter company operating from the Heliport with a Sikorski S.76C++ Helicopter.\n2011: The 'Clubhouse' building which houses the Airfield Cafe/Bar is fully refurbished and relaunched as 'The Airfield Lodge' with new management and longer opening hours.\nJan 2015: The Airfield Cafe/Bar is taken over by City Airport Ltd and renamed as 'Runway 26' with the aim of re-developing the facility to cater for the wider requirements of pilots, visitors and the general public.\nDec 2020: Former University of Manchester (Fluid Dynamics Research Laboratory) building, by the main entrance, is completely refurbished internally to be used as a bespoke Ambulance operations base by Mersey Medical Services Ltd, a private medical company, who now operate from this base 24hrs a day. The building has been named Harrison House in honour of Dr. Reginald Harrison credited with being the founder of the modern day Ambulance service in the U.K.\n", "description": "City Airport &
