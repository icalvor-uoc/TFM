{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "Prostate cancer: Classification systems\nThe D'Amico classification stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the three-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score and high PSA) in stratifying patients.\nThe Partin tables predict pathologic outcomes (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion) based on the same three variables and are published as lookup tables.\nThe Kattan nomograms predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.\nThe UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score predicts both pathologic status and recurrence after surgery. It offers accuracy comparable to the Kattan preoperative nomogram and can be calculated without tables or a calculator. Points are assigned based on PSA, grade, stage, age, and percentage of cores positive; the sum yields a 0\u201310 score, with every two points representing roughly a doubling of risk of recurrence. The CAPRA score was derived from community-based data in the CaPSURE database. It has been validated among over 10,000 prostatectomy patients, including patients from CaPSURE; the SEARCH registry, representing data from several Veterans Health Administration and military medical centers; a multi-institutional cohort in Germany; and the prostatectomy cohort at Johns Hopkins University. More recently, it has been shown to predict metastasis and mortality following prostatectomy, radiation therapy, watchful waiting, or androgen deprivation therapy.\nThe UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommends use of the Cambridge Prognostic Groups (CPG) 5-tier model when determining treatment options. The rationale for the change related to recent evidence, which suggests that 5-tier risk stratification model was better at predicting prostate cancer specific mortality than older 3-tier models  The CPG model has been tested and validated in studies including >80,000 men  The NICE CPG model and treatment recommendations can be viewed at the NICE guideline website.\n", "description": "Prostate cancer is related to the following Classification: and, seminal vesicle, nomograms, Veterans Health Administration, UK.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostate%20cancer>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classification>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Classification of Prostate cancer"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/a931f6a1-cfe7-45e7-b6cc-aad192b4c814>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/a931f6a1-cfe7-45e7-b6cc-aad192b4c814>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "and"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seminal_vesicle>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seminal_vesicle>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "seminal vesicle"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nomogram>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nomogram>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "nomograms"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Veterans_Health_Administration>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Veterans_Health_Administration>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Veterans Health Administration"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/31888c83-0105-4d33-bb14-89092c2491a0>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "UK"]]}]}
