{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "Beaujolais Blanc & Beaujolais Ros\u00e9 - A small amount of white wine made from Chardonnay is grown in the region and used to produce Beaujolais Blanc or Beaujolais-Villages Blanc. The vineyards to produces these wines are normally found in the limestone soils of the far northern extremities of the region. Part of the reason for the small production of these wines is that many of the vineyards overlap into the M\u00e2connais regions and producers will usually choose to label their wines under the more marketable and well known M\u00e2con Blanc designation. There is also regulations in several Beaujolais communes restricting growers to dedicating no more than 10% of their vineyard space to white wine grape varieties. Beaujolais Ros\u00e9 made from Gamay is permitted in the Beaujolais AOC but is rarely produced.", "description": "The relation \"made from\" holds between Beaujolais Blanc and Chardonnay", "statements": [["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/48ae608c-c91f-4ffb-8554-e9b846cb4505>", "<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>", "<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/48ae608c-c91f-4ffb-8554-e9b846cb4505>", "<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#subject>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/ef2714cb-5f3f-49c5-8cb9-3976c7e54f1e>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/48ae608c-c91f-4ffb-8554-e9b846cb4505>", "<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#predicate>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/48ae608c-c91f-4ffb-8554-e9b846cb4505>", "<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chardonnay>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/48ae608c-c91f-4ffb-8554-e9b846cb4505>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/ontogen/zeta/kindOfRelation>", "made from"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/ef2714cb-5f3f-49c5-8cb9-3976c7e54f1e>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Beaujolais Blanc"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chardonnay>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Chardonnay"]]}]}
