{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "Beaujolais: Appellations\nBeaujolais AOC  is the most extended appellation allowed to be used in any of the 96 villages, but essentially covering 60 villages, and refers to all basic Beaujolais wines. A large portion of the wine produced under this appellation is sold as Beaujolais Nouveau. Annually, this appellation averages around 75 million bottles a year in production. Maximum level of sulfur dioxide in the Nouveau is limited at 100\u00a0mg/l.\nBeaujolais-Villages AOC, the intermediate category in terms of classification, covers 39 communes/villages in the Haut Beaujolais, the northern part of the region accounting for a quarter of production. Some is sold as Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau, but it is not common. Most of the wines are released in the following March after the harvest. The terrain of this region is hillier with more schist and granite soil composition than what is found in the regions of the Beaujolais AOC and the wine has the potential to be of higher quality. If the grapes come from the area of a single vineyard or commune, producers can affix the name of their particular village to the Beaujolais-Villages designation. Since most of the villages of Beaujolais, outside of those classified as Cru Beaujolais, villages have little international name recognitions most producers choose to maintain the Beaujolais-Villages designation. The maximum permitted yields for this AOC is 58 hl/ha. These wines are meant to be consumed young, within two years of their harvest. Several of the communes in the Beaujolais-Villages AOC also qualify to produce their wines under the M\u00e2connais and Saint-V\u00e9ran AOCs. The Beaujolais producers that produce a red wine under the Beaujolais-Villages appellation will often produce their white wine under the more internationally recognized names of M\u00e2con-Villages or Saint-V\u00e9ran.\nCru Beaujolais, the highest category of classification in Beaujolais, account for the production within ten villages/areas in the foothills of the Beaujolais mountains. Unlike Burgundy and Alsace, the phrase cru in Beaujolais refers to an entire wine-producing area rather than an individual vineyard. Seven of the Crus relate to actual villages while Brouilly and C\u00f4te de Brouilly refer to the vineyards areas around Mont Brouilly and Moulin-\u00e0-Vent is named for a local windmill. These wines do not usually show the word 'Beaujolais' on the label, in an attempt to separate themselves from mass-produced Nouveau; in fact vineyards in the cru villages are not allowed to produce Nouveau. The maximum yields for Cru Beaujolais wine is 48 hl/ha. Their wines can be more full-bodied, darker in color, and significantly longer-lived. From north to south the Beaujolais crus are- Saint-Amour, Juli\u00e9nas, Ch\u00e9nas, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, R\u00e9gni\u00e9, Brouilly and C\u00f4te de Brouilly.\nBeaujolais Blanc & Beaujolais Ros\u00e9 - A small amount of white wine made from Chardonnay is grown in the region and used to produce Beaujolais Blanc or Beaujolais-Villages Blanc. The vineyards to produces these wines are normally found in the limestone soils of the far northern extremities of the region. Part of the reason for the small production of these wines is that many of the vineyards overlap into the M\u00e2connais regions and producers will usually choose to label their wines under the more marketable and well known M\u00e2con Blanc designation. There is also regulations in several Beaujolais communes restricting growers to dedicating no more than 10% of their vineyard space to white wine grape varieties. Beaujolais Ros\u00e9 made from Gamay is permitted in the Beaujolais AOC but is rarely produced.\n", "description": "Beaujolais is related to the following Appellations: Beaujolais AOC, Beaujolais-Villages AOC, Cru Beaujolais, Beaujolais Blanc.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beaujolais>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appellations>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Appellations of Beaujolais"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e3af9c52-6678-42a5-8bf0-de866f3be826>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e3af9c52-6678-42a5-8bf0-de866f3be826>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Beaujolais AOC"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e87e1fcb-c908-4725-ba29-74acbad36aa6>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e87e1fcb-c908-4725-ba29-74acbad36aa6>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Beaujolais-Villages AOC"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/17a06fe0-50f2-410c-8e85-53c159003287>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/17a06fe0-50f2-410c-8e85-53c159003287>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Cru Beaujolais"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/694076b5-9f4f-4488-9e67-7592a01b31af>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/ef2714cb-5f3f-49c5-8cb9-3976c7e54f1e>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/ef2714cb-5f3f-49c5-8cb9-3976c7e54f1e>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Beaujolais Blanc"]]}, {"evidence": "Beaujolais: Beaujolais crus\nBrouilly - The largest cru in Beaujolais, situated around Mont Brouilly and contains within its boundaries the sub-district of C\u00f4te de Brouilly. The wines are noted for their aromas of blueberries, cherries, raspberries and currants. Along with C\u00f4te de Brouilly, this is the only Cru Beaujolais region that permits grapes other than Gamay to be produced in the area with vineyards growing Chardonnay, Aligote and Melon de Bourgogne as well. The Brouilly cru also contains the famous Pisse Vieille vineyard (roughly translated as 'piss old woman!') which received its name from a local legend of a devout Catholic woman who misheard the local priest's absolution to 'Allez! Et ne p\u00e9chez plus.' (Go! And sin no more.) as 'Allez! Et ne pissez plus.' (Go! And piss no more).

One of the more full-bodied crus in this category. It is noted for its redcurrant and raspberry flavors. Local lore in the region states that this cru was the site of the first vineyards planted in Beaujolais by the Romans.\nChiroubles - This cru has vineyards at some of the highest altitudes among the Cru Beaujolais.

The region is noted for the high level of manganese that is in the soil, which can be toxic to grape vines in high levels. The level of toxicity in Moulin-\u00e0-Vent does not kill the vine but is enough to cause chlorosis and alter the vine's metabolism to reduce yields severely.
