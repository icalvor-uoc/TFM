White: Physical phenomena during visions\n'In passing into vision, she gives three enrapturing shouts of 'Glory!' which echo and re-echo, the second, and especially the third, fainter but more thrilling than the first, the voice resembling that of one quite a distance from you, and just going out of hearing.'\nFor a few moments \nshe would swoon\n, having no strength.  Then she would be instantly \nfilled with superhuman strength\n, sometimes rising to her feet and walking about the room. She frequently moved hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person.  In 1845, she held her parents' 18.5 pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour.  She weighed 80 pounds at the time.\nShe did not breathe\n during the entire period of a vision that ranged \nfrom fifteen minutes to three hours\n.  Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state.\nHer eyes were always open without blinking\n; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object.  Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena.\nShe was utterly \nunconscious of everything transpiring around her\n, and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings.\nWhen she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the day time or a well-lighted room at night.  She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, 'D-a-r-k.' She was then limp and strengthless.\n", "description": "Ellen G.
