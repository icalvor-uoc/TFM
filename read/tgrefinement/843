{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "The flowers are conspicuous and are borne on singly on pedicels in leaf axils. They are generally vivid lemon-yellow in colour, but with a white centre in some species. The calyx has five sepals, forming a shallow cup. The corolla has five petals, usually imbricate and thereby forming a shallow bowl, though this is less evident if the petals happen to be narrow, as sometimes occurs on a particular plant. The petals are inserted into the throat of the calyx cup. There are ten stamens, more or less set in two whorls of five, inserted between the base of the gynoecium and the petals. The carpels typically are five in number, but may vary from about 3 to 10. They are connate and remain so in the fruit, which forms a synaptospermic diaspore that may act as a trample burr, being spread by sticking to animals' feet. The styles are terete and the stigmas capitate.", "description": "styles is related to terete", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Style_(botany)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_botanical_terms>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Style_(botany)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "styles"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_botanical_terms>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "terete"]]}, {"evidence": "The flowers are conspicuous and are borne on singly on pedicels in leaf axils.
