{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "Azimuth thruster: Types of azimuth thrusters\nMechanical transmission, which connects a motor inside the ship to the outboard unit by gearing.  The motor may be diesel or diesel-electric.  Depending on the shaft arrangement, mechanical azimuth thrusters are divided into L-drive and Z-drive.  An L-drive thruster has a vertical input shaft and a horizontal output shaft with one right-angle gear.  A Z-drive thruster has a horizontal input shaft, a vertical shaft in the rotating column and a horizontal output shaft, with two right-angle gears.\nElectrical transmission, more commonly called pods, where an electric motor is fitted in the pod itself, connected directly to the propeller without gears. The electricity is produced by an onboard engine, usually diesel or gas turbine. Invented in 1955 by Friedrich W. Pleuger and Friedrich Busmann (Pleuger Unterwasserpumpen GmbH), ABB Group's Azipod was the first product using this technology.\n", "description": "Azimuth thruster is related to the following Types: Mechanical transmission, Electrical transmission.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azimuth%20thruster>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1a6bba9e-f3a1-498a-b0ee-24e56e6d5520>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Types>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1a6bba9e-f3a1-498a-b0ee-24e56e6d5520>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1a6bba9e-f3a1-498a-b0ee-24e56e6d5520>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Types of Azimuth thruster"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1a6bba9e-f3a1-498a-b0ee-24e56e6d5520>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transmission_(mechanics)>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transmission_(mechanics)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Mechanical transmission"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1a6bba9e-f3a1-498a-b0ee-24e56e6d5520>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diesel-electric_transmission>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diesel-electric_transmission>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Electrical transmission"]]}]}
