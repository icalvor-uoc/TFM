It aired on 5 February 1983. In it, the main character, Rapunzel is taken from her parents by an evil witch, and is brought up in an isolated tower that can only be accessed by climbing her unnaturally long hair. Jeff Bridges played the prince and Rapunzel's father, Shelley Duvall played Rapunzel and her mother, Gena Rowlands played the witch, and Roddy McDowall narrated.\nA 1988 German film adaption, Rapunzel oder Der Zauber der Tr\u00e4nen\u00a0[de] (meaning 'Rapunzel or the Magic of Tears'), combines the story with the lesser-known Grimm fairy tale Maid Maleen. After escaping the tower, Rapunzel finds work as a kitchen maid in the prince's court, where she must contend with an evil princess who aims to marry him.\nA 1990 straight-to-video animated film adaption by Hanna-Barbera and Hallmark Cards, simply titled Rapunzel featured Olivia Newton-John narrating the story. The major difference between it and the Grimm fairy tale is that instead of making the prince blind, the evil witch transforms him into a bird, possibly a reference to The Blue Bird, a French variant of the story.\nInto the Woods is a musical combining elements from several classic fairy tales, in which Rapunzel is one of the main characters; it was also filmed for television in 1991 by American Playhouse. The story depicts Rapunzel as the adoptive daughter of the Witch that the Baker (Rapunzel's older brother, unbeknownst to him) is getting some items from who is later rescued by a prince. In the second half of the play, Rapunzel is killed by the Giant's Wife. The Witch then grieves for her and sings, 'Witch\u2019s Lament.'\nA film adaptation by The Walt Disney Company was released late in 2014 where Rapunzel is portrayed by Mackenzie Mauzy. The difference from the play is that Rapunzel is not killed by the Giant's Wife. Instead, she rides off into the woods with her prince in order to distance herself from the Witch who raised her.\nIn Barbie as Rapunzel (2002), Rapunzel was raised by the evil witch Gothel (voiced by Anjelica Huston) and she acted as a servant for her. She uses a magic paintbrush to get out of captivity, but Gothel locks her away in a tower.\nIn Shrek the Third (2007), Rapunzel (voiced by Maya Rudolph) was friends with Princess Fiona. She is shown to be the true love of the evil Prince Charming and helps to fool Princess Fiona and her group when they try to escape from Prince Charming's wrath.\nWalt Disney Animation Studios' Tangled (2010), which is a loose retelling and a computer-animated musical feature film. Princess Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is more assertive in character, and was born a princess. Her long blonde hair has magical healing and restoration powers. A woman named Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) kidnaps Rapunzel for her magical hair which would help maintain her youth. Rather than a prince, Rapunzel encounters an elusive thief named Flynn Rider/Eugene Fitzherbert (voiced by Zachary Levi). Rapunzel also features in Disney's Tangled short sequel, Tangled Ever After. There is also a series based on the events after the movie and before the short named Tangled The Series/ Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure and a movie which leads to the series called Tangled: Before Ever After.\nWalt Disney Pictures hired Ashleigh Powell to write the script for a live action Rapunzel movie. It is unknown if the film will be a remake of Tangled, a whole new adaptation, or a combination of both.\n", "description": "Rapunzel is related to the following Film: The Story of Rapunzel, Shelley Duvall, Rapunzel oder Der Zauber der Tr\u00e4nen\u00a0[de], straight-to-video, Into the Woods, film adaptation, Barbie as Rapunzel, Shrek the Third, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rapunzel>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Film>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Film of Rapunzel"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1b497a1f-b182-4702-a962-e99432e01232>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/1b497a1f-b182-4702-a962-e99432e01232>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "The Story of Rapunzel"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shelley_Duvall>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shelley_Duvall>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Shelley Duvall"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/693e4cd9-d886-4181-b299-7a4b6ee6b33c>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/693e4cd9-d886-4181-b299-7a4b6ee6b33c>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Rapunzel oder Der Zauber der Tr\u00e4nen\u00a0[de]"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Straight-to-video>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Straight-to-video>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "straight-to-video"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/a721c8fc-3c9a-4012-8e87-52a8dc9fad30>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/a721c8fc-3c9a-4012-8e87-52a8dc9fad30>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Into the Woods"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Into_the_Woods_(film)>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Into_the_Woods_(film)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "film adaptation"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/b43833fa-91d3-401a-975b-3c8537e0843c>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/b43833fa-91d3-401a-975b-3c8537e0843c>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Barbie as Rapunzel"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2465efe9-ffa8-4061-b9f7-afddead16661>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2465efe9-ffa8-4061-b9f7-afddead16661>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Shrek the Third"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Walt Disney Animation Studios"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/e614b28e-c75c-4afd-9da5-7927f2c394b2>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Pictures>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Pictures>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Walt Disney Pictures"]]}]}
