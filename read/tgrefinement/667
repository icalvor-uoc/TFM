The university of Coimbra decides that this 'great ceremony was an infallible means of preventing the earth from quaking.'\nEdgar Allan Poe \u2013 In 'The Pit and the Pendulum', Poe uses the auto-da-f\u00e9 as a reference point for the narrator as he tries to determine what is happening to him.\nGiuseppe Verdi \u2013 In his 1866 opera Don Carlos, Verdi includes a pivotal scene in the third act that depicts the beginning of an auto-da-f\u00e9 in front of the Cathedral of Valladolid in Spain where heretics are about to be burned at the stake.\nHerman Melville \u2013 In Moby-Dick, near the end of Chapter 54, mentions auto-da-f\u00e9 in passing: ''Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs the risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.'' In 'The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade' (1857), set on a Mississippi steamboat filled with colorful characters and the Devil himself as the con-man, Melville weaves an allegory on how easily one may win over a person's, or for that matter, an entire people's confidence. The story begins and ends with the appearance of mysterious young men, the latter of whom is described as wearing tattered red and yellow clothes reminiscent of 'a victim in auto-da-fe.\u201d The book opens with the words 'Dedicated to victims of Auto da Fe.'\nLeonard Bernstein composed and produced a musical adaptation of Voltaire's Candide in 1956, featuring a song called Auto-da-F\u00e9 that includes the chorus, 'It's a lovely day for drinking and for watching people fry,' referring to the spectacle of public executions.\nElias Canetti won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981 for his work, especially his novel Die Blendung (1935), literally 'The Blinding', translated into English as Auto-da-F\u00e9 (1946).\nFyodor Dostoevsky begins a chapter of The Brothers Karamazov with a 'splendid Auto-da-F\u00e9'. The chapter is famously called 'The Grand Inquisitor'.\nIn Thornton Wilder's 1927 novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey, a central character, the friar Brother Juniper, is burned for heresy in an auto-da-f\u00e9 in early 18th-century Peru. Although the novel is fictional, autos-de-f\u00e9 did occur in Lima, Peru at least as late as 1733.\nTennessee Williams wrote a one-act play entitled Auto-da-F\u00e9 (1938).\nRoger Zelazny wrote a short story, Auto-da-F\u00e9, which appeared in Dangerous Visions, 1967.\nIn Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, the final climactic book burning is repeatedly referred to as auto-da-f\u00e9.\nMan of La Mancha, 1965 musical with a book by Dale Wasserman.
