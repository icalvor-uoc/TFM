Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.\nWhile the past and the present rule out some courses of action, a human choice is always possible between a finite number of realistic options, which often enables the experienced analyst to specify the 'most likely scenarios' of what could happen in the future. Some things cannot happen, and some things are more likely to happen than others.\nOnce an important choice has been made and acted upon, this will have an effect on the realm of possibilities; in particular, it will shift to a greater or lesser extent the parameters delimiting what can happen in the future. Thus, once 'a train of events has been set in motion', it will foreclose other possibilities, and also it might open up some new ones. If masses of people make important new choices, whether in response to circumstances or in response to a new idea, a qualitative change occurs; in that case, most people begin to behave differently.\nThe process of history is both determined, in that the given parameters delimit the possible outcomes, but also open-ended, insofar as human action (or inaction) can change the historical outcomes within certain limits. Human history-making is therefore a reciprocal interaction between what people do, and the given circumstances.\nTo some extent at least, it is possible to predict with useful accuracy what will happen in the future, if one has sufficient experience, knowledge, and insight into the relevant causal factors at work as well as how they are related. This may be a work of science or sustained practical experience. In turn, future perspectives can importantly influence human action in the present.\nIn historical analysis and portrayals, the analytical challenge is to understand what part of a course of events is attributable to conscious human actions and decisions, what part is shaped by the combination of given circumstances in which the human actors had to act, and what exactly is the relationship between them (the link between the 'part' and the 'whole').\nBecause the ability to prove historical assessments scientifically is limited, ideology, a mind-set or a social mentality about the state of the world typically plays an important role in the perspectives people develop (Mandel refers here to an idea by Lucien Goldmann). With hindsight, it may be possible to trace out accurately why events necessarily developed in the way that they did, and not otherwise. But at the time they are happening, this is usually not, or not completely possible, and the hope (or fear) for a particular future may play an important role (here Mandel refers to the philosophy of Ernst Bloch). In addition, ideology influences whether one looks upon past events as failures or successes (as many historians have noted, history is often rewritten by the victors in great historical battles to cast themselves in an especially positive light). There is no 'non-partisan' history-writing in this sense, at best we can say the historian had full regard for the known facts pertaining to the given case and frankly acknowledges his biases.\n'History' in general cannot be simply defined as 'the past', because it is also 'the past living in the present' and 'the future living in the present'. Historical thinking is not just concerned with what past events led to the present, but also with those elements from the past which are contained in the present and elements that point to the future. It involves both antecedents and consequents, including future effects. Only on that basis can we define how people can 'make history' as a conscious praxis.\nThe main reason for studying history is not because we[who?] should assign praise or blame, or simply because it is interesting, but because we need to study past experience to understand the present and the future. History can be seen as a 'laboratory', the lab-record of which shows how, under given conditions, people tried to achieve their goals, and what the results of their experimentations were. This can provide insight into what is likely or unlikely to succeed in future. At the very least, each generation has to come to grips with the experience of the previous generation, as well as educating the future generation.\nThe theory of historicism according to which the historical process as a whole has an overall purpose or teleology (or 'grand design') is rejected. With Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Mandel thought that ''History does nothing... It is people, real, living people who do all that... \u201chistory\u201d is not, as it were, a person apart, using people as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of people pursuing their aims'. With the proviso that people did so within given parameters not of their own making, allowing us to identify broad historical movements as determinate processes. The historical process is also not a matter of linear progress according to inevitable stages\u2014both progress and regress can occur, and different historical outcomes are possible depending on what people do.\n", "description": "Parametric determinism is related to the following Ten: vacuum, The process, ideology, praxis, who?, historicism.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parametric%20determinism>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ten>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Ten of Parametric determinism"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vacuum>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vacuum>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "vacuum"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Process_(Skinny_Puppy_album)>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Process_(Skinny_Puppy_album)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "The process"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ideology>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ideology>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "ideology"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Praxis_(process)>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Praxis_(process)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "praxis"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2b84e7b7-039c-4c0a-8a06-3cc6e5665d73>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2b84e7b7-039c-4c0a-8a06-3cc6e5665d73>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "who?"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/27dc6b9c-28bc-4754-ab8c-18b8426a5e9f>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historicism>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historicism>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "historicism"]]}]}
