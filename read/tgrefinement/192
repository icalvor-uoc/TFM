{"friendlyName": "Triplegen Stage", "units": [{"evidence": "Florida State Road 713: History\nUntil early 1978, northbound motorists turned west onto Indrio Road (SR 614) and north onto Emerson Road (SR 607). After 8.5 miles (13.7\u00a0km) of Emerson Road, northbound motorists turned west onto SR 60, which connected with I-95 six miles (10\u00a0km) from SR 607.\nWhen a nine-mile (14\u00a0km)-long section of I-95 opened in 1978, northbound motorists stayed on Indrio Road (SR 614) after turning left from SR 713. The then-new I-95 interchange was three miles (4.8\u00a0km) to the west of SR 713 on Indrio Road.\nWhen an additional six miles (9.7\u00a0km) of I-95 were opened in late 1978, motorists were directed eastward on SR 68 from SR 713 to connect with I-95. Most stayed with this route after a 0.3-mile (0.48\u00a0km)-long section (to SR 70) was opened in early 1979, even though Florida Department of Transportation posted signs encouraging them to avoid SR 713 altogether and use SR 70. The final segment of I-95 to be finished in Florida (Stuart to Palm Beach Gardens) was finally opened in 1987.\n", "description": "Florida State Road 713 is related to the following History: SR 614, I-95, Florida Department of Transportation.", "statements": [["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida%20State%20Road%20713>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#related>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/History>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "History of Florida State Road 713"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_Road_614_(Florida)>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_Road_614_(Florida)>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "SR 614"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interstate_95_in_Florida>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interstate_95_in_Florida>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "I-95"], ["<https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/488dc178-c583-4014-8ac0-fcc4b95e68bb>", "<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#narrower>", "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Department_of_Transportation>"], ["<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Department_of_Transportation>", "<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", "Florida Department of Transportation"]]}]}
