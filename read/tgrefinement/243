In 1986, Johnny Blaze makes a deal with Mephistopheles to save the former's father from cancer in return for serving the devil at a future date, only for Blaze's father to die in an accident the next day. In the present, Mephistopheles transforms Blaze into his latest Ghost Rider to hunt down his traitorous son Blackheart before the demon can find the Contract. After receiving help from Slade, Blaze defeats Blackheart and defies Mephistopheles by keeping his Ghost Rider powers instead of returning them despite being offered to have them removed.\nMephistopheles as the Devil appears in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. He takes the form of a man named Roarke (portrayed by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) and fathered a son with a woman named Nadya after saving her life. Employing Nadya's mercenary ex, Ray Carrigan, Roarke intends to use the boy, Danny, as his host and gain full access to his powers on Earth instead of relying on bodies that rapidly decay.
