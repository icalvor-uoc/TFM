Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.  This latest book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of a superb writer.\n Paul Brooks\nMidweek - Herald - 17 May 2017", "annotations": [{"surface": "crime-", "start": 78, "end": 84, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crime_film", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Greek", "start": 224, "end": 229, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Wellington", "start": 243, "end": 253, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wellington", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Greek", "start": 784, "end": 789, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "yarn", "start": 1008, "end": 1012, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yarn", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Paul Brooks", "start": 1106, "end": 1117, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Brooks", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Greek", "start": 224, "end": 229, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/4973dfce-35f1-4d9b-bd8b-8bfc9296ff62", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Wellington 1950", "start": 243, "end": 258, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/3b37c22c-e017-4064-b20d-5db7d72e7543", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Chris Moisa", "start": 285, "end": 296, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/ad2b2ca2-53ce-4053-9dc5-bd2674a68a26", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "New Zealand", "start": 754, "end": 765, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/fcb74308-9ec2-4369-918e-5a171f715aa0", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "1950", "start": 769, "end": 773, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/50cd2bc2-425d-4edc-9047-c0ed927eedaf", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Greek", "start": 784, "end": 789, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/cd905c23-f748-465b-8add-e481a0c73761", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Chris", "start": 1013, "end": 1018, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/a173676e-7140-4eed-b6f9-4cfe2ad53d12", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Paul Brooks", "start": 1106, "end": 1117, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/83bd45f4-aa42-4b4b-9d3e-35977de3288a", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "May 2017", "start": 1140, "end": 1148, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/596b4f82-fcdd-43ba-9197-d243597d8090", "source": "spacy"}]}, [{"text": "Wolves in Dogs Clothing, Christodoulos Moisa 2017,ISBN\u00a0978-1548977368", "annotations": [{"surface": "ISBN", "start": 50, "end": 54, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISBN_(identifier)", "source": "a"}, {"surface": "Christodoulos Moisa", "start": 25, "end": 44, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christodoulos_Moisa", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Christodoulos Moisa", "start": 25, "end": 44, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/cd170951-ffe2-4a60-bd0d-05b944c39414", "source": "spacy"}]}], {"text": "CRITICS COMMENTS: 'The novel is set in Cyprus during the coup and the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the major plot based on a series of brutal murders is supported by a number of equally intriguing subplots .... the writing style is a combination thriller and interesting snippets about history, politics, society and mythology. It is a style that I appreciate. I learn while I am kept enthralled by the action. ... the Turkish invasion, which Chris although from a Greek background, writes about with admirable balance and gives another depth to the novel.
