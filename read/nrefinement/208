The CDDP was created during the 2006 Legislative Session with the passage of House Bill 371, which was sponsored by Representative Gayle Harrell. The purpose of the CDDP is to provide access to the drugs and supplies used to treat cancer to patients who are uninsured and do not qualify for Medicare, third-party insurance or any other state or federal programs. Section 499.029, F.S., authorizes the donation of cancer drugs and supplies by any person or entity to a participant facility for re-dispensing to an eligible recipient.", "annotations": [{"surface": "Gayle Harrell", "start": 211, "end": 224, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gayle_Harrell", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "cancer", "start": 311, "end": 317, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "uninsured", "start": 338, "end": 347, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_insurance", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Medicare", "start": 371, "end": 379, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicaid", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "insurance", "start": 393, "end": 402, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "cancer", "start": 493, "end": 499, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer", "source": "dbpedia_spotlight"}, {"surface": "Division", "start": 4, "end": 12, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/dbb84747-326c-46bb-a5cd-e5ca2cde2df2", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "the Cancer Drug Donation Program", "start": 39, "end": 71, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2beeee44-e5cb-49d7-b0ce-e00e8b03de77", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "CDDP", "start": 73, "end": 77, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/d04f586b-1da9-4a78-930c-d2d1878a9f19", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "CDDP", "start": 84, "end": 88, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/c5fc21db-5930-489f-95be-accbece31e7a", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "the 2006", "start": 108, "end": 116, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/2cd50ab3-c659-42b9-83a9-39a1f6be5b70", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Legislative Session", "start": 117, "end": 136, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/b53d9a58-5af1-427c-a9d0-4fe3e80fe2a2", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "House", "start": 157, "end": 162, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/db2bac05-f912-4776-a5c6-3ce28f5fc4d0", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Bill 371", "start": 163, "end": 171, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/098ee2e2-240c-4004-a82e-129ecc6d5b3c", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Gayle Harrell", "start": 211, "end": 224, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/0eb4231e-e668-4159-a637-43b88a4e897a", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "CDDP", "start": 245, "end": 249, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/0ab21af9-8906-4a64-a827-3516a1fda966", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Medicare", "start": 371, "end": 379, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/04cee6a0-dc9c-4220-abec-ce302d7c8af5", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "third", "start": 381, "end": 386, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/3502215a-291f-4447-8db4-4027b5cb0aa8", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "Section 499.029", "start": 443, "end": 458, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/de72d6ef-e42d-441c-b5c6-0a6d5c44eb43", "source": "spacy"}, {"surface": "F.S.", "start": 460, "end": 464, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/c8334047-bebe-4ab2-b645-b4a3d6bff437", "source": "spacy"}]}, {"text": "For more information on the Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics, visit here.", "annotations": [{"surface": "the Division of Drugs, Devices and Cosmetics", "start": 24, "end": 68, "uri": "https://calvoritmo.com/tfm/entity/67d31722-2e9d-4726-9ce6-3f25602c37b5", "source": "spacy"}]}], "subsections": []}]}]}}
