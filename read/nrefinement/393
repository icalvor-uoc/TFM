When Advantage is turned on at deuce (40-40), one player has to win the game. The player who wins the next point takes the game. If Win by 2 Games is turned on, at 5-5, the player must then win by two games, however at 6-6, a tiebreak is played to determine who wins the set. The tiebreak rules are the first player to reach seven points win the tiebreak and set, at 6 points all, the player who wins two consecutive points wins the tiebreak and the set. The Games per set option allows the player to choose the number of games to win a set. The minimum is two games and the maximum is 6. Sets per Match determines how many sets are in the match. As with typical tennis, 1, 3, or 5 sets can be played. A1 difficulty determines the hardness of the game. The default level is Pro, however the player can set the level at Amateur for newer players or Veteran for the big time tennis players. When Time Bombs are turned on every 5 seconds or so whomever last hit the ball will get blown up with the time bomb. Whenever smoke appears the player needs to get the ball back on the other side of the court before they get blown away. Team Match Timer when turned on, is much like a chess clock whereas once the ball is hit the time stops but when the opponent returns the shot, it begins again. The match timer can also be enabled. Whoever is in the lead when time runs up wins. Challenges are set by the empire, Heavy G. When turned on at the beginning of the match, Heavy G will present a challenge which ever play wins the challenge first receives 30-seconds of unlimited turbo. The Outlaw Blockers is a malicious square of digital fiberglass that slides back and forth along the net. Known as the great equalizer, the player can try to avoid it, or try timing it, but it will ultimately best the player. Weather can also be switched on or off. When turned on there is a chance for rain or snow.", "annotations": [{"surface": "tennis", "start": 760, "end": 766, "uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis", "source": "a"}, {"surface": "chess",
