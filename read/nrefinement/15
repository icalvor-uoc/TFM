The phrase f\u00fbts de ch\u00eane (oak casks) will sometimes appear on the wine label of these oak aged wines. The region is noted for the high level of manganese that is in the soil, which can be toxic to grape vines in high levels. The level of toxicity in Moulin-\u00e0-Vent does not kill the vine but is enough to cause chlorosis and alter the vine's metabolism to reduce yields severely.
